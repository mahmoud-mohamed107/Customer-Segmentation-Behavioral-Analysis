# Customer-Segmentation-Behavioral-Analysis

- In machine learning, we can classify learning into three types:
  
Supervised Learning: This uses labeled data.
Unsupervised Learning: This uses data without labels.
Reinforcement Learning: This learns from feedback based on actions taken.

- In this project, we will use unsupervised learning to identify different customer segments for marketing strategies based on purchasing behaviors, such as buying frequency, product types, and spending amounts. By analyzing this data, the brand can group customers into segments like eco-conscious buyers, luxury shoppers, or budget-conscious consumers. This segmentation allows the brand to tailor its marketing messages and campaigns to each specific group.
