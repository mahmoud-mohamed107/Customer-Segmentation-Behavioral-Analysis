## Machine Learning Overview  

In machine learning, we can classify learning into three types:  

1. **Supervised Learning**: This approach uses labeled data.  
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: This method operates on data without labels.  
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: This technique learns from feedback based on the actions taken.  

## Project Overview  

In this project, we will employ **unsupervised learning** to identify various customer segments for marketing strategies based on purchasing behaviors. Key factors for analysis include:  

- Buying frequency  
- Product types  
- Spending amounts  

By examining this data, the brand can categorize customers into segments such as:  

- Eco-conscious buyers  
- Luxury shoppers  
- Budget-conscious consumers  

This segmentation enables the brand to customize its marketing messages and campaigns for each specific group.  

### Insights and Recommendations  

Focus on tailoring marketing strategies to each identified segment based on their unique purchasing behaviors.
